  \caption{Training data for 6457 tweets. The counts map, shows us how many tweets are mapped to each cluster. Quality shows the mean distance of objects mapped to a unit to the codebook vector, the smaller the distance the better the representation. The neighborhood disance show the U-Matrix and finally the tweets convergence shows the distance from each node's wheights to the samples represented by that node }
