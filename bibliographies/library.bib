abstract = {Anchor text has been widely used in web search as an effective complement to web page content. This motivates the investigation of similar sources of evidence about relevance. Social media postings often contain links to associated web pages, although typically not with anchor text. In this paper, we explore the use of these links and the text in the social postings as a form of anchor text (social anchors) for improving ad hoc search. Using a test collection based on ClueWeb09 together with associated social media, we show that by incorporating social anchor features, search effectiveness for "ad hoc" tasks can be significantly improved compared to state-of-the-art approaches. We also investigate the relative importance of social anchor features for retrieval, and show that query-dependent features are usually the key to better search performance.},

@article{Cataldi2010nnknfk,
abstract = {Twitter is a user-generated content system that allows its users to share short text messages, called tweets, for a variety of purposes, including daily conversations, URLs sharing and information news. Considering its world-wide distributed network of users of any age and social condition, it represents a low level news flashes portal that, in its impressive short response time, has the principal advantage. In this paper we recognize this primary role of Twitter and we propose a novel topic detection technique that permits to retrieve in real-time the most emergent topics expressed by the community. First, we extract the contents (set of terms) of the tweets and model the term life cycle according to a novel aging theory intended to mine the emerging ones. A term can be defined as emerging if it frequently occurs in the specified time interval and it was relatively rare in the past. Moreover, considering that the importance of a content also depends on its source, we analyze the social relationships in the network with the well-known Page Rank algorithm in order to determine the authority of the users. Finally, we leverage a navigable topic graph which connects the emerging terms with other semantically related keywords, allowing the detection of the emerging topics, under user-specified time constraints. We provide different case studies which show the validity of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Streaming user-generated content in the form of blogs, microblogs, forums, and multimedia sharing sites, provides a rich source of data from which invaluable information and insights maybe gleaned. Given the vast volume of such social media data being continually generated, one of the challenges is to automatically tease apart the emerging topics of discussion from the constant background chatter. Such emerging topics can be identified by the appearance of multiple posts on a unique subject matter, which is distinct from previous online discourse. We address the problem of identifying emerging topics through the use of dictionary learning. We propose a two stage approach respectively based on detection and clustering of novel user-generated content. We derive a scalable approach by using the alternating directions method to solve the resulting optimization problems. Empirical results show that our proposed approach is more effective than several baselines in detecting emerging topics in traditional news story and newsgroup data. We also demonstrate the practical application to social media analysis, based on a study on streaming data from Twitter. Â© 2011 ACM.},
