\begin{acknowledgments}
  First of all, I need to thank Professor Pável for introducing me to the world of Machine Learning, without his teachings during the course of web analysis and information extraction, I probably wouldn't have chosen a thesis in this area. Also, I thank him for his full and expertise support during the development of this thesis. 

  Sofia Martins, for all the support when things got rougher, and for proofreading this thesis more times than it is humanly bearable.

  To my parents and family, whom dedicated the last 25 years into making me an educated person, and for always worring with my success.

  I need to thank all my friends and coleges from Instituto Superior Técnico, in special to Afonso Oliveira whom was more than a friend, but an actual mentor. Guilherme Vale, Mario Nzualo, Fábio Domingos, João Vasques, João Andrade, David Dias, Rui Costa, Artur Balanuta and probably many more, for all the working hours we have spent together, I couldn't have finished my course without you.

  Finally, to everybody that makes Taguspark Campus probably one the best places to work in the world. It was an awesome journey.
