\fancychapter{Results}
\section{Testing framework}
For helping the reader first explain how did you achieve your experimental results. This may include (but is not limited to): the algorithm parameters; the computer or harware platform performing the operations; the comparative algorithms, frameworks or platforms parameters.

\input{tables/table_example.tex}

For a table example see the file \verb"table_example.tex". It will print table~\ref{table:table1}. Always remember that, unlike with figures, the caption should appear above the table (not below). Also, always remember that the command \verb"\label" should always appear after the command \verb"\caption". If you place it before the caption, the reference will not appear correctly.

\section{The results}
There is usual a future work section as well
As usual you should finish your thesis with the experimental results.

\section{Summary}

It is typical a good ideia to have an ending section summarizing the chapter.

% Ensure that the next chapter starts in a odd page
