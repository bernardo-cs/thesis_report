With the evolution of social media platforms, the amount of unlabeled information has gone skyrocketing. The process of labeling this kind of information is evermore complex. Typical approaches used on the WEB for Topic Detection and Tracking cannot be directly applied due to the small amount of text produced per tweet, orthographic errors, abbreviations and so on.

In this thesis, we propose and analyze a new form of topic detection and tracking on social networks. By leveraging the social relations between authors of the gathered content, and apply them to the clustering process.

In order to achieve this, we proposed some modifications to the artificial neural network  and clustering algorithm --- Self Organizing Maps.
