 \fancychapter{Implementation}
While the first chapter focus on your ideas the second can focus on the implementation. Though that may change from thesis to thesis.

\begin{figure}
\begin{boxedverbatim}
DefineGlobals
   clock   alias   clk
   reset   alias   rst
   max_latency     17
   feedback        0
   DefineInputs
      X   std_logic_vector(11 downto 0)
   EndInputs
   DefineOutputs
      Y   std_logic_vector(11 downto 0)
   EndOutputs
EndGlobals
\end{boxedverbatim}
\caption{An example code section.}
\label{chp4:img}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{chp4:img} shows an example of a \verb"\boxedverbatim" section. It allows to put blocks of code within a frame. I think makes a prettier printing.

\section{Summary}

It is typical a good ideia to have an ending section summarizing the chapter.

% Ensure that the next chapter starts in a odd page
